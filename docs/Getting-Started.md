# Getting Started

New to Starwipe's API? This is a high-level overview of what our documentation will enable you to do. Use it as a checklist, and when you're ready, our toolkit will be yours to implement.

The API documentation is searchable for ease of use. All of the endpoints are included along with parameters and responses. Most endpoints also include examples to help get you started. The docs are updated monthly so the information is current and reliable. If you have comments or suggestions, let us know. We love feedback and we're here to help. 

## Register for an API Key
Starwipe uses API keys for [authentication](Authentication.md). Follow the steps below to acquire an API key and get started as a Starwipe developer:
1. Create a Starwipe account or log in to your existing account at [starwipe.com](https://starwipe.com).
2. Go to the developer dashboard at [developer.starwipe.com/dashboard](https://developer.starwipecom/dashboard) and follow instructions to register as a developer.
3. Implement the authorization flow to receive an API key. You can have 2 API keys active at a time.

## Send a Test Call
You can test your new API key using the **Try It Out** feature in the [API Reference](../reference/photohostingAPI.yaml) section and start experimenting.
