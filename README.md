# ptw330
Group portfolio project for PTW 330. API documentation site for a fictitious photo hosting service.

# Project Overview
Starwipe Productions has created a simulation of a proprietary photo hosting API for use with third-party platforms. Weâ€™ve generated an array of requests, parameters, and responses based on industry leading examples. We have also included user models built from research related to real world API users.

Our aim is to provide a clear easy to translate experience for developers to add a new set of tools to their belt.
